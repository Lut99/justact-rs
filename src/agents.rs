/***** LIBRARY *****/
/// Defines an agent in the system, at least abstractly.
pub trait Agent: Identifiable {}

/// Extends an [`Agent`] with the capacity to think, i.e., do something.
///
/// This is effectively the trait that unifies everything into a concrete implementation. Its
/// associated types force the implementer to get concrete about everything.
pub trait RationalAgent: Agent {
    /// The messages exchange by the agent.
    type Message;
    /// The target used by the agent to aim for other agents.
    type Target;
    /// The type of errors raised by reasoning.
    type Error: Error;


    /// Runs the underlying Agent code for one run.
    ///
    /// This effectively "runs" the agent itself. This allows it to inspect any statements, enactments, agreements and/or times, as well as create them.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    /// - `agrs`: A set of globally synchronized [`Agreements`] for the agent to mutate (if consensus is reached) or not.
    /// - `times`: A set of globally synchronized [`Times`] for the agent to mutate (if consensus is reached) or not.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    /// An [`AgentPoll`]-type that determines what the runtime should do with this agent.
    ///
    /// # Errors
    /// Only fatal errors that prevent the Agent from participating in the system should cause this function to error. Examples are failures to properly attach to some remote registry or queue.
